# FirstGuiCalculator
v1.0: This is my first project created with qt and C++. This is a simple calculator that can do the casual operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The Calculator can also change the state of the number meaning if its + or -. 
v1.1: TODO: implement clearing of the display, in order to be able to continue calculating without restarting the program.
