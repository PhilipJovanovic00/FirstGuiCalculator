# FirstGuiCalculator
v1.0: This is my first project created with qt and C++. This is a simple calculator that can do the casual operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The Calculator can also change the state of the number meaning if its + or -. 
v1.1: The Display can now be Cleared 
v1.2: KeyEvents added, the numbers and basic operators can now be writted either by clicking the Button or by typing it on the keyboard.
v1.3: The Clear and Equal Button can now also be executed by typing on the keyboard, clear is on c and enter on Return, dont use the enter on your numpad. The
change of the state can be done with s, because - is reserved for the subtraction, i'll try to fix this in the future, but for now it is done as said.


Information: The Master branch is experimental, the main branch always has working functions. If you want to use the project, please
clone the main branch, so there are no problems with executing and working with the code.

How to use the Calculator:
Here I will explain to you how the user input through the keyboard works, most of it is straight forward, but some inputs are a bit unusual.
Feel free to change this, if you do not like it.
Add: +
Subtract: -
Multiply: *
Divide: /
Change the state (if the number is + or -): s (press this after you entered a number to make it negative)
Clear the Display: c
Numbers: Just type the Key for the number that you want, either above the letters or on the numpad.
Equals: For this you can use the Enter under the backspace, also called return, or the Enter on your Numpad, i have implemented both.
